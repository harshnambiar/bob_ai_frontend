        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is an AI agent?</h3>
            <p>An AI Agent is a software program that can do a particular task for you, without needing additional help from you in the intermediate steps. The task could be simple like automated introductory replies to your clients via email, or more complex like building an entire mobile phone game as per your specifications. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Bob AI?</h3>
            <p>Bob AI is a specialized AI agent coming to the Boba Network. Its responses and contexts are specifically fine tuned to cater to the Boba Ecosystem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What will Bob AI be able to do?</h3>
            <p>Bob AI will be able to answer your queries about the Boba Network, be it upcoming events, price info and metrics, or even code-related queries. You will also be able to swap tokens or buy NFTs with simple conversational commands or instructions to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will my wallet details be safe?</h3>
            <p>Bob AI only calls the transaction functions (while using AI based context optimization) on your behalf and you will still be prompted to sign the transaction yourself. In other words, your keys are safe and totally in your own control. Bob AI does not and cannot complete transactions without your consent and sign-up, so your funds are wallet are safe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does it cost to use Bob AI?</h3>
            <p>It depends on the query. Those queries that ask us to perform an operation like a swap are totally free. A lot of queries seeking information about the Boba Network or its ecosystem are also free, thanks to the large pre-fabricated reserves of context that Bob AI has. The other custom queries are charged in a pay-as-you-go fashion, where you will be prompted to transact before the custom request can be processed.</p>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>When launch?</h3>
            <p>Currently, we are looking for beta testers and inviting applications for the same. You can use the 'Join Beta Program' link on the home page if you want to be a part of the program.</p>
