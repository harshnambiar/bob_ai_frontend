    "where can i stake on boba?": "You can stake your $BOBA tokens primarily through the official Boba Network ecosystem, where staking allows you to earn rewards (typically up to 5% APY based on recent community reports) while participating in governance via the Boba DAO. Staking converts $BOBA to xBOBA, which grants voting rights and a share of network transaction fees. Here's a breakdown of the main options: \n 1. Official Boba Network Gateway (Recommended for Native Staking) \n Platform: Boba Network Gateway (hub.boba.network or gateway.boba.network). \n How to Stake: \n Connect an EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Boba Network (add the chain via Chainlist.org if needed). \n Ensure your $BOBA is on the Boba L2 chain (bridge from Ethereum L1 if necessary using the built-in light bridge tool). \n Navigate to the 'Stake' or 'Earn' tab, select your amount, confirm the transaction, and your tokens will be locked as xBOBA. \n Rewards: Yield from network fees and incentives; no fixed lockup period, but unstaking may involve a short delay. \n 2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) on Boba Network (For Liquidity Providing as 'Staking') \n Platforms: OolongSwap (oolongswap.com) or other Boba-based DEXs like those listed in the ecosystem explorer. \n How to Stake: \n Provide liquidity to $BOBA pairs (e.g., BOBA/USDC), which is often labeled as 'staking' in the UI for earning LP rewards and fees. \n Rewards: Trading fees plus potential token incentives; higher APY (up to 20%+ in pools) but with impermanent loss risk. \n 3. Third-Party Centralized Platforms \n Platform: CoinUnited.io (coinunited.io). \n How to Stake: Deposit $BOBA to their wallet, select a staking period (flexible options available), and earn passive yield. \n  Rewards: Advertised up to 125% APY (variable based on network conditions), but verify current rates as they fluctuate. \n Note: This is custodial staking—easier for beginners but involves trusting the platform with your tokens.",

    "how is gas fee on boba": "Boba offers much lower gas fees than Ethereum, typically around 10 Gwei or less, due to its architecture. This can be paid using the native Boba token ($BOBA) or the gas token of the underlying blockchain. The actual gas price on Boba L2 is updated regularly, influenced by Ethereum L1 gas price changes, with a maximum percentage change of 5% to prevent sharp fluctuations. \n Key Aspects of Boba Network Gas Fees: \n Low Fees: Boba Network reduces Ethereum's high gas fees, making it more affordable to use. \n Flexible Payment: You can pay for transactions using the native BOBA token or the underlying blockchain's native asset. \n Dynamic Pricing: The gas price on Boba L2 adjusts based on Ethereum's gas price. \n Stable Pricing: To ensure stability, the gas price on Boba L2 is capped, preventing drastic changes in a single update cycle.",
    "how do i setup a node on boba?": "Running a node allows you to sync with the network, validate transactions, and interact with the blockchain independently. The official documentation recommends using Docker for simplicity, supporting execution engines like Geth or Erigon. This guide focuses on running a full non-sequencer node (the most common setup for operators). Note that Boba currently operates its own sequencer, so community nodes act as verifiers or full sync nodes without direct incentives in the current protocol release. \n Prerequisites \n Software: Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system (e.g., via official Docker docs for your OS). Git for cloning the repo. \n  Hardware: While not explicitly stated, expect at least 16-32 GB RAM, 2-4 CPU cores, and 1-2 TB SSD storage for mainnet snapshots (databases can exceed 500 GB). Use a stable internet connection for syncing. \n Knowledge: Basic familiarity with command-line tools and blockchain concepts. \n Warnings: \nAlways verify downloaded snapshots using SHA256 checksums to avoid corrupted or malicious files. \n Running a node consumes significant bandwidth and storage; monitor your setup. \n For testnets (e.g., Boba Sepolia), use smaller snapshots for testing. \n No protocol-level incentives exist for verifiers yet (e.g., no gas compensation for challenges), but future upgrades may introduce them. \n Step 1: Clone the Repository \n Open a terminal and run: \n git clone https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba.git \n cd boba/boba-community \n This gives you access to Docker Compose files and configs for Boba networks. \n Step 2: Configure Environment Variables \n Copy the sample config: \n cp .env.example .env \n Edit .env with a text editor (e.g., nano .env or VS Code). Key variables include: \n Node versions (check the software release page for latest tags). \n RPC endpoints for L1 (e.g., Ethereum for Boba Ethereum).  \n Paths to data directories. \n Descriptions in .env.example explain each; customize for mainnet or testnet. \n Step 3: Download and Prepare Database Snapshots \n Snapshots speed up syncing. Download based on your target network and engine (Geth or Erigon). Verify with sha256sum <filename> against hashes on the snapshot downloads page. \nBoba Mainnet (Erigon): \n curl -o boba-mainnet-erigon-db-1149019.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mainnet/boba-mainnet-erigon-db-1149019.tgz \n Boba Mainnet (Geth): \n curl -o boba-mainnet-geth-db-114909.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mainnet/boba-mainnet-geth-db-114909.tgz \n Boba Sepolia Testnet (Erigon): \n curl -o boba-sepolia-erigon-db.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sepolia/boba-sepolia-erigon-db.tgz \n Boba Sepolia Testnet (Geth): \n curl -o boba-sepolia-geth-db.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sepolia/boba-sepolia-geth-db.tgz \n Extract the snapshot (replace data.tgz with your file): \n  tar xvf data.tgz \n This creates a data directory (e.g., /db). For OP Sepolia (if testing Optimism compatibility), use: \n curl -o op-sepolia-genesis.json -sL https://networks.optimism.io/op-sepolia/genesis.json \n erigon init --datadir=/db genesis.json \n Build Erigon from source if needed: Clone https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-erigon and run make erigon. \n Step 4: Generate JWT Secret \n This secures communication between execution and consensus layers: \nopenssl rand -hex 32 > jwt-secret.txt \n Step 5: Update Docker Volumes \n Edit your docker-compose.yml (or network-specific file like docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml) to mount volumes correctly. Example: \nservices: \n  l2: \n    volumes: \n      - ./jwt-secret.txt:/config/jwt-secret.txt \n       - /path/to/your/db:/db  # Replace with your extracted data path \n  op-node: \n    volumes: \n       - ./jwt-secret.txt:/config/jwt-secret.txt \n       - /path/to/your/db:/db:ro  # Read-only for op-node \n Step 6: Start the Node \n Pull images and run in detached mode (-d). Use the appropriate Compose file. \n Boba Mainnet with Geth: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml up -d \n Boba Mainnet with Erigon: \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-erigon.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-erigon.yml up -d \n Boba Sepolia Testnet with Geth: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-geth.yml pull \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-geth.yml up -d \nBoba Sepolia Testnet with Erigon: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-erigon.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-erigon.yml up -d \nThe node will sync in the background. Monitor logs with docker compose logs -f. \n Step 7: Verify and Monitor \n Check sync status: Query your node's RPC endpoint (default: http://localhost:8545) via tools like curl or MetaMask. \n Example health check: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' http://localhost:8545 \n For issues: View logs (docker compose logs), ensure L1 RPC is accessible, and join Boba Discord for support. \n Alternative: Run from Source \nIf Docker isn't suitable, follow the Run a Node from Source guide for manual builds of Geth/Erigon and OP Node. \n Node Types and Roles \n Full Node: Syncs the entire chain (what this guide sets up); used for querying and light validation. \nSequencer Node: Orders transactions (permissioned; Boba runs the only one currently). \n Verifier Node: Challenges invalid state roots (no incentives deployed yet; rare use case). \n For advanced setups (e.g., BobaBNB), check multichain docs. Always refer to the official node operators section for updates.",
    "how secure is boba": "Boba Network uses an Optimistic Rollup Framework, a technology that bundles transactions off-chain and presumes them valid. This model leverages the underlying security of the base layer, such as Ethereum. Thus, each Boba deployment is as safe as the underlying blockchain. So long as the underlying blockchain itself is 'live' (not actively censoring transactions), Boba apps built on it are safe and secure. This security model is backed by a system of 'fraud proofs', whereby users are paid to reveal bad transaction results published to the Boba Optimistic based chain. Boba also utilizes a hybrid computing system to augment compute, which helps maintain the network's security. \n https://boba.network/education",

    "can i run arbitrarily compiled Smart Contract native code, or a Smart Contract in a WASM environment?": "As of now, you cannot. This might change in the future, though.",
    "how are cross chain messages relayed?": "Boba Network uses the eth-optimism message relayer, a service for relaying messages from L2 to L1. This service can also be used to relay fast messages for the L1CrossDomainMessengerFast without waiting for the dispute period. The message relayer uses L1MultiMessageRelayer/L1MultiMessageRelayerFast to relay messages together in batches. \n https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/tree/develop/packages/message-relayer \n https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/01e4f94fa2671cfed0c6c82257345f77b3b858ef/cross-dom-comm",
    "why do i get an error during integration tests while running boba locally?": "Is the error './scripts/wait-for-sequencer.sh is getting timed out'? There are precedents of this.

    "why am i getting a gas fee error that the gas limit is 1 quadrillion wei?": "The Boba Network throws this error anytime the gas price is equal to, or more than three times the expected gas price for any given transaction. The gas fee for the transaction isn't actually that high, but this is the built-in setting in Boba Network to protect you from unexpectedly high transaction fees.",
    "which bridge can i use on boba?": "You can use one of these bridges on Boba Network: \n 1. Offical Bridge: \n https://hub.boba.network/bridge \n 2. Synapse Bridge: \n https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=ETH&outputChain=288 \n 3. Celer Bridge: \n https://cbridge.celer.network/1/288/BOBA \n The complete list of bridges can be browsed here: \n https://boba.network/dapps/?type=Bridge",
    "can i skip the sequencer and directly submit transactions?": "Yes, it is possible to do so. You can submit transactions directly on L1 by calling 'enqueue()' on the Canonical Transaction Chain (CTC). The sequencer is forced to include your transaction on L2, but it still needs to be up and running.",
    "what is the commitment publishing frequency on boba?": "On the L1, the frequency is roughly once per hour.",
    "what is the duration of the fault challenge period on boba?": "The duration is 7 days.",
    "what are the limits on hybrid compute web2 calls?": "The following limits exist for the hybrid compute web2 calls \n 1. limits strings returned from external endpoints to 322 characters (5*64+2=322). \n 2. allows only one Turing call per execution. \n 3. imposes a 1200 ms timeout on API responses. Hence, please make sure that API responds promptly. If using AWS, note that some of their services take several seconds to spin up from a 'coldstart', and could result in persistent failure of the first call to the intended endpoint.",
    "why does my hybrid compute related transaction only work if i click submit within a few seconds?": "That's because the Hybrid Compute feature puts the Hybrid Compute response in a cache bucket. Your request including a Hybrid Compute request will put the response under a cache key that expires in 5 seconds: \n const turingCacheExpire = 5 * time.Second \n The code details on this can be found here: \n https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba_legacy/blob/develop/l2geth/core/vm/evm.go#L277",
    "is it possible to hide the api key on hybrid compute?": "Currently, this is not possible. But it might be changed in future updates so please follow the announcements on the latest releases for information on the same."
