    "where can i stake on boba?": "You can stake your $BOBA tokens primarily through the official Boba Network ecosystem, where staking allows you to earn rewards (typically up to 5% APY based on recent community reports) while participating in governance via the Boba DAO. Staking converts $BOBA to xBOBA, which grants voting rights and a share of network transaction fees. Here's a breakdown of the main options: \n 1. Official Boba Network Gateway (Recommended for Native Staking) \n Platform: Boba Network Gateway (hub.boba.network or gateway.boba.network). \n How to Stake: \n Connect an EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Boba Network (add the chain via Chainlist.org if needed). \n Ensure your $BOBA is on the Boba L2 chain (bridge from Ethereum L1 if necessary using the built-in light bridge tool). \n Navigate to the 'Stake' or 'Earn' tab, select your amount, confirm the transaction, and your tokens will be locked as xBOBA. \n Rewards: Yield from network fees and incentives; no fixed lockup period, but unstaking may involve a short delay. \n 2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) on Boba Network (For Liquidity Providing as 'Staking') \n Platforms: OolongSwap (oolongswap.com) or other Boba-based DEXs like those listed in the ecosystem explorer. \n How to Stake: \n Provide liquidity to $BOBA pairs (e.g., BOBA/USDC), which is often labeled as 'staking' in the UI for earning LP rewards and fees. \n Rewards: Trading fees plus potential token incentives; higher APY (up to 20%+ in pools) but with impermanent loss risk. \n 3. Third-Party Centralized Platforms \n Platform: CoinUnited.io (coinunited.io). \n How to Stake: Deposit $BOBA to their wallet, select a staking period (flexible options available), and earn passive yield. \n  Rewards: Advertised up to 125% APY (variable based on network conditions), but verify current rates as they fluctuate. \n Note: This is custodial staking—easier for beginners but involves trusting the platform with your tokens.",

    "how is gas fee on boba": "Boba offers much lower gas fees than Ethereum, typically around 10 Gwei or less, due to its architecture. This can be paid using the native Boba token ($BOBA) or the gas token of the underlying blockchain. The actual gas price on Boba L2 is updated regularly, influenced by Ethereum L1 gas price changes, with a maximum percentage change of 5% to prevent sharp fluctuations. \n Key Aspects of Boba Network Gas Fees: \n Low Fees: Boba Network reduces Ethereum's high gas fees, making it more affordable to use. \n Flexible Payment: You can pay for transactions using the native BOBA token or the underlying blockchain's native asset. \n Dynamic Pricing: The gas price on Boba L2 adjusts based on Ethereum's gas price. \n Stable Pricing: To ensure stability, the gas price on Boba L2 is capped, preventing drastic changes in a single update cycle.",
    "how do i setup a node on boba?": "Running a node allows you to sync with the network, validate transactions, and interact with the blockchain independently. The official documentation recommends using Docker for simplicity, supporting execution engines like Geth or Erigon. This guide focuses on running a full non-sequencer node (the most common setup for operators). Note that Boba currently operates its own sequencer, so community nodes act as verifiers or full sync nodes without direct incentives in the current protocol release. \n Prerequisites \n Software: Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system (e.g., via official Docker docs for your OS). Git for cloning the repo. \n  Hardware: While not explicitly stated, expect at least 16-32 GB RAM, 2-4 CPU cores, and 1-2 TB SSD storage for mainnet snapshots (databases can exceed 500 GB). Use a stable internet connection for syncing. \n Knowledge: Basic familiarity with command-line tools and blockchain concepts. \n Warnings: \nAlways verify downloaded snapshots using SHA256 checksums to avoid corrupted or malicious files. \n Running a node consumes significant bandwidth and storage; monitor your setup. \n For testnets (e.g., Boba Sepolia), use smaller snapshots for testing. \n No protocol-level incentives exist for verifiers yet (e.g., no gas compensation for challenges), but future upgrades may introduce them. \n Step 1: Clone the Repository \n Open a terminal and run: \n git clone https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba.git \n cd boba/boba-community \n This gives you access to Docker Compose files and configs for Boba networks. \n Step 2: Configure Environment Variables \n Copy the sample config: \n cp .env.example .env \n Edit .env with a text editor (e.g., nano .env or VS Code). Key variables include: \n Node versions (check the software release page for latest tags). \n RPC endpoints for L1 (e.g., Ethereum for Boba Ethereum).  \n Paths to data directories. \n Descriptions in .env.example explain each; customize for mainnet or testnet. \n Step 3: Download and Prepare Database Snapshots \n Snapshots speed up syncing. Download based on your target network and engine (Geth or Erigon). Verify with sha256sum <filename> against hashes on the snapshot downloads page. \nBoba Mainnet (Erigon): \n curl -o boba-mainnet-erigon-db-1149019.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mainnet/boba-mainnet-erigon-db-1149019.tgz \n Boba Mainnet (Geth): \n curl -o boba-mainnet-geth-db-114909.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mainnet/boba-mainnet-geth-db-114909.tgz \n Boba Sepolia Testnet (Erigon): \n curl -o boba-sepolia-erigon-db.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sepolia/boba-sepolia-erigon-db.tgz \n Boba Sepolia Testnet (Geth): \n curl -o boba-sepolia-geth-db.tgz -sL https://boba-db.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sepolia/boba-sepolia-geth-db.tgz \n Extract the snapshot (replace data.tgz with your file): \n  tar xvf data.tgz \n This creates a data directory (e.g., /db). For OP Sepolia (if testing Optimism compatibility), use: \n curl -o op-sepolia-genesis.json -sL https://networks.optimism.io/op-sepolia/genesis.json \n erigon init --datadir=/db genesis.json \n Build Erigon from source if needed: Clone https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-erigon and run make erigon. \n Step 4: Generate JWT Secret \n This secures communication between execution and consensus layers: \nopenssl rand -hex 32 > jwt-secret.txt \n Step 5: Update Docker Volumes \n Edit your docker-compose.yml (or network-specific file like docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml) to mount volumes correctly. Example: \nservices: \n  l2: \n    volumes: \n      - ./jwt-secret.txt:/config/jwt-secret.txt \n       - /path/to/your/db:/db  # Replace with your extracted data path \n  op-node: \n    volumes: \n       - ./jwt-secret.txt:/config/jwt-secret.txt \n       - /path/to/your/db:/db:ro  # Read-only for op-node \n Step 6: Start the Node \n Pull images and run in detached mode (-d). Use the appropriate Compose file. \n Boba Mainnet with Geth: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-geth.yml up -d \n Boba Mainnet with Erigon: \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-erigon.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-mainnet-erigon.yml up -d \n Boba Sepolia Testnet with Geth: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-geth.yml pull \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-geth.yml up -d \nBoba Sepolia Testnet with Erigon: \ndocker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-erigon.yml pull \n docker compose -f docker-compose-sepolia-erigon.yml up -d \nThe node will sync in the background. Monitor logs with docker compose logs -f. \n Step 7: Verify and Monitor \n Check sync status: Query your node's RPC endpoint (default: http://localhost:8545) via tools like curl or MetaMask. \n Example health check: curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}' http://localhost:8545 \n For issues: View logs (docker compose logs), ensure L1 RPC is accessible, and join Boba Discord for support. \n Alternative: Run from Source \nIf Docker isn't suitable, follow the Run a Node from Source guide for manual builds of Geth/Erigon and OP Node. \n Node Types and Roles \n Full Node: Syncs the entire chain (what this guide sets up); used for querying and light validation. \nSequencer Node: Orders transactions (permissioned; Boba runs the only one currently). \n Verifier Node: Challenges invalid state roots (no incentives deployed yet; rare use case). \n For advanced setups (e.g., BobaBNB), check multichain docs. Always refer to the official node operators section for updates.",
    "how secure is boba": "Boba Network uses an Optimistic Rollup Framework, a technology that bundles transactions off-chain and presumes them valid. This model leverages the underlying security of the base layer, such as Ethereum. Thus, each Boba deployment is as safe as the underlying blockchain. So long as the underlying blockchain itself is 'live' (not actively censoring transactions), Boba apps built on it are safe and secure.

    "what are the specific hardware specs for boba validator nodes?": "Node Architecture in Boba Network \nBoba Network, as an Optimistic Rollup (OP Stack-based Layer 2 on Ethereum and other chains like BNB), does not use traditional \"validator nodes\" in the sense of Proof-of-Stake consensus layers (e.g., Ethereum's consensus client). Instead, it relies on a centralized sequencer for transaction ordering and batch submission to Layer 1, with community-run nodes primarily serving as replica nodes (full L2 execution clients for querying and analytics). The network's fraud-proof mechanism involves verifier nodes, which monitor and challenge invalid state roots submitted by the sequencer, but these are not full-time validators and currently lack deployed incentives (e.g., no Bond Manager contract for gas compensation as of the latest docs).Official documentation (e.g., from docs.boba.network) does not provide explicit hardware specifications for any node types, focusing instead on software setup via Docker or source builds. Based on the OP Stack's Erigon-based architecture and comparable L2 replica/sequencer setups (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum), the following are recommended hardware specs derived from similar Ethereum L2 execution clients. These ensure reliable syncing, state maintenance, and low-latency operation, assuming a full sync from snapshots (which can take hours and require significant initial storage). \n Key ConsiderationsReplica Nodes: These are the most common \"validator-like\" nodes for community operators. They run the L2 Geth/Erigon client to mirror the chain state. Setup involves Docker Compose with env vars for L1 RPC endpoints (e.g., Infura/Alchemy). Syncing uses database snapshots to avoid full historical downloads. No staking or rewards, but useful for dApp indexing or personal RPC. \n Sequencer Node: Currently permissioned (operated by Boba Foundation). Hardware needs are higher due to real-time transaction ordering—aim for the \"recommended\" tier above, plus redundancy (e.g., HA setup). Future decentralization via governance may open this up. \n Verifier Nodes: Anyone can run these to monitor state roots and submit challenges on Ethereum L1. Minimal hardware (minimum specs suffice) since they only activate on disputes. Gas costs for challenges are not yet subsidized. \n Scaling Factors: As Boba supports Hybrid Compute (off-chain AI/ML calls), nodes with GPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA A10) may benefit for local testing, but not required for core validation. \n Cost Estimate: A VPS/cloud instance (e.g., AWS m6i.2xlarge) meeting recommended specs costs ~$100-300/month. \n For setup guides, refer to the official docs at docs.boba.network/node-operators (clone the boba repo and use docker-compose up). If running on testnet (Boba Sepolia), requirements are ~50% lower. Monitor via the Boba Discord for updates, as the network evolves toward full decentralization. \n Recommended Specs: \n CPU: 8-16 cores/16-32 threads @ 3.5GHZ \n RAM: 32-64 GB DDR4/DDR5 \n Storage: 2-4 TB NVMe SSD (high IOPS > 1M) \n Network: 1 GB symmetric, <50ms latency to L1 RPC \n OS/Software: Ubuntu latest or similar, Docker 20+",
    "how does boba's testnet handle spam transactions?": "Boba Network, as an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution using Optimistic Rollups, handles spam transactions primarily through its sequencer-based architecture, fee mechanisms, and integration with Ethereum's security model. While the official documentation (e.g., docs.boba.network) does not explicitly detail anti-spam measures, the following outlines how Boba mitigates spam based on its OP Stack design, governance structure, and operational practices as of September 2025: \n 1. Centralized Sequencer with Fee Market \n Sequencer Role: Boba Network currently relies on a permissioned sequencer (operated by the Boba Foundation) to order and batch transactions before submitting them to Ethereum Layer-1. This sequencer can filter or prioritize transactions based on gas fees, similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee market. \n Fee-Based Deterrence: Transactions on Boba require $BOBA to pay gas fees, which are dynamically adjusted based on network demand. Spam transactions (low-value, high-volume) are deterred by requiring sufficient fees, making it costly to flood the network. Fees are collected in $BOBA and partially redistributed to stakers, aligning incentives. \n Rate Limiting: While not explicitly documented, sequencers can implement rate-limiting or throttling mechanisms to cap transaction submissions from a single address, reducing the impact of spam attacks. \n 2. Optimistic Rollup Fraud-Proof System \n Challenge Period: Boba uses Optimistic Rollups, where transactions are assumed valid but can be challenged during a 7-day dispute window. Spam transactions that attempt to manipulate state (e.g., invalid state updates) can be flagged by verifier nodes running fraud-proof checks. If a malicious batch is detected, verifiers submit a challenge to Ethereum L1, rolling back the invalid state. \n Verifier Incentives: Although incentives for verifiers (e.g., gas reimbursement via a Bond Manager) are not fully deployed as of the latest updates, the system allows community nodes to monitor and counteract spam or malicious activity, ensuring network integrity. \n 3. Governance and DAO Oversight \n Boba DAO Controls: The Boba DAO, governed by $BOBA token holders, can propose and vote on protocol upgrades to address spam vulnerabilities. For example, governance can adjust gas price floors, implement stricter transaction filters, or introduce penalties for abusive behavior. \n Foundation Monitoring: The Boba Governance Foundation actively monitors network activity and can intervene to update sequencer policies or deploy hotfixes, though this is a temporary measure until sequencer decentralization is achieved. \n 4. Hybrid Compute and Off-Chain Checks \n Hybrid Compute Integration: Boba’s unique Hybrid Compute feature, which supports off-chain computation (e.g., AI/ML calls), includes transaction validation logic that can filter out spam before it impacts the on-chain state. Developers can embed anti-spam rules in their dApps, leveraging off-chain processing to reject low-value or repetitive transactions. \n API Rate Limits: For dApps using external APIs via Hybrid Compute, rate-limiting at the API level prevents abuse, indirectly reducing spam load on the network. \n 5. Network Design Mitigations \nBatch Processing: The sequencer batches transactions before submitting to Ethereum L1, reducing the per-transaction cost on L1. This makes spamming less effective, as malicious actors must pay L2 fees without guaranteed disruption to the L1 state. \n L1 Security Backstop: Since Boba’s security is inherited from Ethereum, spam attacks cannot compromise the finality of valid transactions, as all state roots are anchored on L1 and subject to Ethereum’s consensus. \n Limitations and Future Considerations \nCentralized Sequencer Risk: The current permissioned sequencer is a potential single point of failure. If overwhelmed by spam, it could delay transaction processing. The Boba roadmap includes plans for sequencer decentralization (via governance proposals), which would distribute this responsibility and enhance resilience. \n No Explicit Anti-Spam Docs: Boba’s documentation lacks detailed anti-spam policies, suggesting reliance on standard OP Stack mechanisms. Community feedback on platforms like Discord indicates ongoing discussions about spam filters and fee adjustments. \n  Evolving Threat Models: As Boba grows (e.g., with $70M in ecosystem funding announced in July 2025), spam tactics may evolve, prompting governance to propose advanced measures like reputation systems or machine learning-based detection for anomalous transaction patterns. \n Practical Implications \n For users and developers, spam is unlikely to disrupt normal operations due to fee deterrence and sequencer filtering. To minimize exposure: \n DApp Developers: Implement transaction validation in Hybrid Compute logic and use rate-limiting for API calls. \n Node Operators: Run verifier nodes to monitor for malicious batches, contributing to network security. \n Token Holders: Propose governance changes (via Boba DAO) to strengthen anti-spam measures, such as dynamic gas floors or sequencer penalties.",
    "what type of encryption does boba use?": "Boba Network, as an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution built on Optimistic Rollups, does not explicitly define a custom encryption protocol for its core operations in the official documentation (e.g., docs.boba.network). Instead, it leverages standard cryptographic mechanisms inherent to Ethereum and the OP Stack, supplemented by specific encryption practices for its Hybrid Compute feature and network communication. Below is a detailed breakdown of the encryption types used by Boba Network, based on its architecture and available information as of September 2025: \n 1. Ethereum-Compatible Cryptography for Transactions \n Boba inherits Ethereum’s cryptographic framework for transaction signing and data integrity: \n ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): \n Purpose: Secures transaction signing and wallet interactions. \n Details: Boba uses the secp256k1 curve, standard for Ethereum-compatible chains, to sign transactions and verify user identities. Each transaction is signed with a private key to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. \n Application: Applies to all on-chain interactions, including $BOBA token transfers, smart contract calls, and governance voting via the Boba DAO. \n Keccak-256 Hashing: \n Purpose: Ensures data integrity for transaction payloads and state roots. \n Details: Used in Merkle tree constructions for batching transactions and committing state roots to Ethereum Layer-1. This ensures that data submitted by the sequencer is tamper-proof. \n Application: Critical for Optimistic Rollup fraud proofs, where verifiers check state root hashes during the 7-day challenge period. \n 2. Hybrid Compute Encryption \n Boba’s unique Hybrid Compute feature, which enables off-chain computation (e.g., AI/ML or external API calls), introduces additional encryption needs: \n TLS 1.2/1.3 (Transport Layer Security): \n Purpose: Secures communication between Boba nodes and external off-chain compute services. \n Details: When dApps on Boba call external APIs or compute resources (e.g., for AI model execution), data is transmitted over HTTPS using TLS 1.2 or 1.3. This employs AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) in GCM or CBC mode for confidentiality and integrity. \n Application: Ensures that sensitive data (e.g., user inputs for AI queries) remains encrypted during transit to off-chain providers. \n Custom Encryption for Off-Chain Data: \n Purpose: Protects data processed in Hybrid Compute environments. \n Details: Developers can implement application-specific encryption (e.g., AES-256 or RSA) for data sent to off-chain compute nodes. The Boba documentation encourages dApps to use secure channels and encrypt payloads, but specific algorithms depend on the dApp’s implementation. \n Application: Used in scenarios like AI-powered dApps (e.g., NFT minting with generative models), where sensitive data requires protection. \n 3. Node Communication and RPC Security \n TLS for RPC Endpoints: \n Purpose: Secures communication between Boba nodes (e.g., replica nodes, verifiers) and external RPC providers (e.g., Infura, Alchemy). \n Details: Node operators connect to Ethereum L1 and Boba L2 via RPC endpoints, which use TLS 1.2/1.3 with AES-256 encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure data privacy. \n Application: Critical for sequencer-to-L1 batch submissions and node syncing. \n P2P Network Encryption: \n Purpose: Secures peer-to-peer communication between Boba nodes. \n Details: Boba’s Erigon-based execution client (part of the OP Stack) uses Ethereum’s devp2p protocol, which incorporates encrypted handshakes (ECIES with secp256k1) and message encryption to protect node gossip and data exchange. \n Application: Ensures that replica nodes and verifiers communicate securely when syncing chain state or broadcasting fraud-proof challenges. \n 4. Governance and DAO Security \n Smart Contract Security: \n Purpose: Protects $BOBA token governance operations. \n Details: The $BOBA token contract (ERC-20 with Votes extension) uses Ethereum’s cryptographic standards (ECDSA, Keccak-256) to secure voting and delegation. Votes are recorded on-chain with cryptographic signatures to prevent manipulation. \n Application: Ensures that DAO proposals and voting outcomes are verifiable and tamper-proof. \n Timelock Encryption: \n Purpose: Secures governance actions with delayed execution. \n Details: Boba DAO uses a timelock contract (inspired by OpenZeppelin’s Governor framework) to delay proposal execution, with cryptographic checks to ensure only authorized changes are applied. \n Application: Prevents malicious governance spam by enforcing secure, auditable delays. \n Practical Implications \n For Users: Transactions are secured by ECDSA and Keccak-256, requiring no additional encryption setup. Use wallets like MetaMask with secure key management. \n For Developers: When building dApps with Hybrid Compute, implement TLS 1.3 and AES-256 for off-chain data. Refer to Boba’s developer guides for secure API integration. \n For Node Operators: Ensure RPC endpoints use TLS and configure nodes with secure P2P settings (see docs.boba.network/node-operators).",
    "how does boba support real-time gaming applications?": "Somnia’s sub-second finality and 1M+ TPS enable real-time gaming via MultiStream’s parallel data processing. Games like Chunked leverage this for seamless multiplayer interactions, with low gas fees (<$0.01) ensuring cost-effective microtransactions.",
    "what is the process for third party validators to join boba?": "Boba Network, an Optimistic Rollup Layer-2 on Ethereum and BNB Chain, does not feature traditional \"validators\" like Proof-of-Stake chains (e.g., Ethereum). Instead, it relies on a permissioned sequencer for transaction ordering, with third parties able to run replica nodes (full L2 execution clients for syncing and querying) or verifier nodes (for monitoring state roots and submitting fraud-proof challenges). These contribute to decentralization and security without staking requirements or rewards (as of September 2025). The sequencer remains operated by the Boba Foundation, with future decentralization planned via Boba DAO governance.The process for third-party node operators is permissionless for replicas and verifiers—no formal application or approval is needed. Setup is straightforward using Docker or source builds, as outlined in the official documentation. Recent notices (e.g., March 2025 upgrades) emphasize keeping nodes updated for compatibility. \n Step-by-Step Process to Join as a Third-Party Node Operator \n Review Hardware and Software Requirements: \n Ensure your setup meets the recommended specs: 8-16 CPU cores, 32-64 GB RAM, 2-4 TB NVMe SSD, 1 Gbps network, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. \n Familiarize yourself with the Erigon-based architecture and OP Stack tools. No GPU is required unless testing Hybrid Compute locally. \n Clone the Boba Repository: \n Use Git to clone the official repo: git clone https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba.git. \n Checkout the latest stable branch (e.g., git checkout mainnet for mainnet or sepolia for testnet). \n Install Dependencies: \n Install Docker (version 20+), Docker Compose, Go (1.21+), and Node.js. \n Configure environment variables in a .env file, including L1 RPC endpoints (e.g., Infura or Alchemy for Ethereum) and Boba chain IDs (288 for mainnet, 28882 for Sepolia testnet). \n Deploy the Node: \n For replica nodes: Run docker-compose up -d to start the L2 execution client (Erigon/Geth hybrid). This syncs the chain state from snapshots (available via official links) to avoid full historical downloads. \n For verifier nodes: Enable fraud-proof mode in the config (add --verifier flag). Verifiers monitor sequencer-submitted state roots on Ethereum L1 and can submit challenges during the 7-day dispute window—no incentives yet, but gas costs are user-borne. \n Monitor logs with docker logs -f boba-node and verify sync via RPC queries (e.g., curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"id\":1}' http://localhost:8545). \n Sync and Test: \n Initial sync takes hours to days, depending on snapshots. Use the Boba Explorer (explorer.boba.network) to confirm your node's block height matches the chain tip. \n Test by submitting a sample transaction or querying via your node's RPC endpoint. \n Maintenance and Upgrades: \n Regularly pull updates from the repo and restart with docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d. \n Join the Boba Discord or Telegram for alerts (e.g., recent Spectra upgrade in March 2025 required node updates). \n For production, set up monitoring tools like Prometheus for uptime. \n Key Considerations \n Replica Nodes: Ideal for dApp developers or indexers; they mirror the chain without active validation. \n Verifier Nodes: Enhance security by watching for invalid states—anyone can run one to participate in fraud proofs. \n No Rewards or Staking: Unlike validators on other chains, Boba nodes don't earn fees. Participation supports decentralization, with future incentives possible via DAO proposals. \n Testnet First: Start on Boba Sepolia (requirements ~50% lower) to practice before mainnet. \n Troubleshooting: If sync fails, check L1 RPC reliability or use community snapshots. For Hybrid Compute integration, additional API keys may be needed. \n This process democratizes access, aligning with Boba's permissionless ethos. For the latest guides, visit docs.boba.network/node-operators or join the Boba community on Discord for real-time support.",

    "what is the unlock schedule of the $boba token?": "The last wave of $BOBA token unlocks has already taken place in July 2025.",
    "how is the boba token governance?": "The $BOBA token is the native governance token of Boba Network, an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution powered by Optimistic Rollups and Hybrid Compute technology. It enables decentralized decision-making through the Boba DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), where token holders collectively steer the network's development, upgrades, and ecosystem initiatives. This model ensures community-driven evolution, aligning incentives for developers, validators, and users while leveraging Ethereum's security. \n Key Governance Mechanisms \n Voting Structure: Boba DAO operates on a \"one token, one vote\" principle. Each $BOBA token staked or held grants one vote, promoting proportional representation based on holdings. \n Proposal Submission and Voting: Holders can submit governance proposals for network upgrades, parameter changes, funding allocations, or protocol enhancements. Voting occurs on-chain, with decisions requiring a quorum (typically a percentage of staked tokens) and majority approval. Proposals follow predefined guidelines to maintain efficiency and security. \n Delegation: To encourage broader participation, holders can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives (e.g., community leaders or delegates) without transferring tokens. This is facilitated via the ERC-20 Votes extension in the $BOBA smart contract, which tracks vote history through checkpoints. \n Staking Integration: Staking $BOBA yields xBOBA (a receipt token) and provides voting rights. Stakers earn rewards from a portion of network transaction fees, incentivizing long-term alignment with the DAO's goals. Staking also contributes to network security by supporting validators. \n Roles and Utilities in Governance \n Beyond voting, $BOBA fuels the ecosystem: \n Execution and Incentives: $BOBA pays for off-chain compute in Hybrid Compute calls (e.g., AI models or APIs), ensuring sustainable operations for dApps. \n DAO Oversight: The Boba Governance Foundation, a non-profit entity, supports the DAO by funding development and fostering adoption, but ultimate control rests with token holders. \n Recent Developments: As of July 2025, the Foundation secured $70M in commitments to expand the ecosystem, including AI-powered dApps, while resolving FTX-related token uncertainties to bolster stability. \n Tokenomics Relevant to Governance \n $BOBA has a maximum supply of 500 million tokens, with vesting schedules to prevent dumps and promote steady distribution. Circulating supply is approximately 493 million as of September 2025. Governance ensures fair allocation, with portions reserved for community initiatives, grants, and incentives.This token-based model democratizes control, making Boba Network adaptable for mass adoption while minimizing centralization risks. For hands-on participation, connect an EVM-compatible wallet to the Boba gateway to stake, delegate, or propose via the DAO interface.",
    "where can i report suspicious or unlawful use of boba?": "For compliance-related queries or to report suspicious transactions on the Boba Network, the recommended approach is to reach out through their official channels, typically found on their website or legal documentation. While there isn't a specific public-facing \"compliance contact\" email listed directly, Boba Network encourages reporting violations or suspicious activity either through their official community forum, where compliance breaches or suspicious content can be reported and escalated to law enforcement if needed, or through general support channels outlined on their main website. \n Here are the useful steps and contacts: \n  Report suspicious transactions: Use the official forum or support forms on the Boba website to submit your concern. \n For immediate reporting or legal escalations: Mention your compliance-related issue explicitly in your message for proper routing. \n No direct compliance officer or specific email is published for the Boba Network at this time; the official support channels are the best available route.",
    "what is the difference between ethereum and boba?": "Boba is a Layer 2 network, It can be considered an augumentation over Ethereum. Just like Ethereum, we can create and interact with Solidity smart contracts using the same wallet software as in case of Ethereum. However, Boba does not have a consensus algorithm of its own and relies on Ethereum, meaning that it is 'as secure as the underying Layer 1'.",
    "how quicky can i bridge assets from ethereum to boba?": "Boba has developed a swap-based mechanism to deliver a smooth user experience for moving funds across chains. Porting assets from L1 to L2, L2 to L1, or between two L2s (as long as they are both EVM-compatible), is fast and dependable. \n The users who choose to take advantage of this bridging between L1 and L2 will pay a small convenience fee that is shared among the liquidity providers of the pools backing the swaps. Acting as liquidity providers is just the first of several staking opportunities Boba will roll out to the community. The higher level goal is to encourage broad participation in the operations and governance of Boba. \n One of the easiest way to bridge funds from and to Boba is the Light Bridge. \n https://hub.boba.network/bridge",
    "why should i build on boba?": "Boba, being an L2 has significantly lower gas fee than Ethereum, or even Binance. It not only helps Ethereum scale, but also allows contracts to tap into advanced off-chain compute capabilities that are not available on other chains. Boba also has an ecosystem fund to support early-stage projects that are just starting out and planning to launch interesting apps. This is in the form of grants programs, and incubators where promising developers are connected to credible investors.",
