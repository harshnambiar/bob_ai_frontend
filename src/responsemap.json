    "how do i setup a node on somnia?": "",
    "how secure is somnia": "Somnia is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for high-performance applications, and its security model is built around a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with a MultiStream protocol. Here are key aspects of its security: \n 1. Proof-of-Stake with Slashing: Somnia uses a PoS system where validators stake tokens to participate in network consensus. Malicious behavior, such as double-signing or downtime, results in slashing penalties, aligning validator incentives with network security. \n 2. MultiStream Consensus: This protocol, inspired by Autobahn BFT, separates data production from consensus. Validators operate independent data chains, while a separate consensus chain ensures global transaction ordering using a modified Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm. This reduces vulnerabilities by isolating consensus processes. \n 3. Sufficient Decentralization: Somnia prioritizes 'sufficient' rather than maximal decentralization to balance security and performance. It initially operates with 100 globally distributed validator nodes, with plans to expand as the network matures. Hardware requirements are set between Solana and Aptos node specs to ensure robust participation without compromising performance. \n 4. Advanced Cryptographic Techniques: Posts on X suggest Somnia employs advanced cryptographic protocols like homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation (MPC) for secure data handling, though these claims require further verification. \n 5. CertiK Monitoring: Somnia is tracked by CertiK’s Skynet for security audits, on-chain monitoring, and bug bounties, indicating proactive security measures. \n 6. Immutable Transactions: The network ensures tamper-proof transactions, enhancing security through immutability and transparency. \n While Somnia’s architecture emphasizes security, its long-term track record is still developing, as it remains in the testnet phase. Investors and developers should monitor validator decentralization and real-world stress tests for a complete assessment.",

    "what is somnia's roadmap?": "Somnia’s roadmap is not fully detailed in public sources, but available information outlines key milestones and ongoing efforts: \n Testnet Phase (Ongoing): Somnia launched its Shannon Testnet on February 20, 2025, following DevNet benchmarks that achieved over 1 million transactions per second (TPS). The testnet focuses on scalability, third-party validator integration, and staking protocols to enhance decentralization. It has processed over 3.6 million transactions across 300,000+ unique addresses. \n Mainnet Launch (2025): Somnia is gearing up for its mainnet launch later in 2025, though no specific date is confirmed. The mainnet will support fully on-chain applications, including gaming, DeFi, and metaverse platforms. \n    Ecosystem Expansion: Somnia has introduced 14 decentralized applications (dApps) on its testnet, covering DeFi, gaming, AI, and metaverse use cases. Projects like Chunked (a sandbox MMO) and Sparkball (a multiplayer sports game) are driving transaction volume. A $10 million ecosystem grant program supports developer engagement. \n    Developer Tools and Interoperability: Somnia is focusing on low-code tools like Somnia Builder and omnichain protocols to enable seamless asset transfers across blockchains. It aims to unify gaming, metaverse, and NFT ecosystems into a 'Virtual Society'. \n    Community Engagement: Initiatives like Galxe campaigns, daily check-ins, and a potential airdrop for testnet participants are part of Somnia’s strategy to attract 1 million users to stress-test the network. \n    Future Goals: Somnia aims to support real-time, data-intensive applications at scale, with a focus on gaming and social platforms. Long-term, it seeks to establish a decentralized creator economy with interoperable digital assets. \n    The roadmap emphasizes scalability, developer adoption, and ecosystem growth, but specific timelines beyond the mainnet launch are unclear.

    "how many transactions happen daily on somnia?": "Somnia’s transaction volume is primarily reported from its testnet phase, as the mainnet is not yet live. Available data highlights: \n    Peak Performance: Somnia’s testnet achieved a record of 80 million transactions in a single day, driven largely by the sandbox MMO game Chunked, which alone generated 250 million transactions over a week with over 70,000 concurrent users. \n    Testnet Activity: The Shannon Testnet has processed over 3.6 million transactions across 300,000+ unique addresses, but daily averages are not consistently reported. The 80 million transaction peak is an outlier tied to specific testnet activities. \n    Network Capacity: Somnia claims a capacity of over 1 million TPS, with sub-second finality and sub-cent fees, demonstrated in DevNet benchmarks. However, real-world daily transaction volumes depend on user activity and dApp adoption, which are still scaling.\n    Comparison: The 80 million daily transactions surpass Ethereum’s peak of 1.9 million and Solana’s peak of 66.9 million, though these figures reflect testnet conditions, not sustained mainnet performance.\n    Since Somnia is in testnet, daily transaction volumes fluctuate based on testing activities and are not representative of mainnet performance. Once the mainnet launches, consistent daily metrics will depend on adoption and use cases like gaming and DeFi.
