    "how secure is boba": "Boba Network uses an Optimistic Rollup Framework, a technology that bundles transactions off-chain and presumes them valid. This model leverages the underlying security of the base layer, such as Ethereum. Thus, each Boba deployment is as safe as the underlying blockchain. So long as the underlying blockchain itself is 'live' (not actively censoring transactions), Boba apps built on it are safe and secure. This security model is backed by a system of 'fraud proofs', whereby users are paid to reveal bad transaction results published to the Boba Optimistic based chain. Boba also utilizes a hybrid computing system to augment compute, which helps maintain the network's security. \n https://boba.network/education",

This implies that every aspect of security against hacks and exploits possessed by Ethereum or any other chain Boba supports gets called upon for Boba transactions and smart contracts as well. This security model is backed by a system of 'fraud proofs', whereby users are paid to reveal bad transaction results published to the Boba Optimistic based chain.

    "what is boba's roadmap?": "Somnia’s roadmap is not fully detailed in public sources, but available information outlines key milestones and ongoing efforts: \n Testnet Phase (Ongoing): Somnia launched its Shannon Testnet on February 20, 2025, following DevNet benchmarks that achieved over 1 million transactions per second (TPS). The testnet focuses on scalability, third-party validator integration, and staking protocols to enhance decentralization. It has processed over 3.6 million transactions across 300,000+ unique addresses. \n Mainnet Launch (2025): Somnia is gearing up for its mainnet launch later in 2025, though no specific date is confirmed. The mainnet will support fully on-chain applications, including gaming, DeFi, and metaverse platforms. \n    Ecosystem Expansion: Somnia has introduced 14 decentralized applications (dApps) on its testnet, covering DeFi, gaming, AI, and metaverse use cases. Projects like Chunked (a sandbox MMO) and Sparkball (a multiplayer sports game) are driving transaction volume. A $10 million ecosystem grant program supports developer engagement. \n    Developer Tools and Interoperability: Somnia is focusing on low-code tools like Somnia Builder and omnichain protocols to enable seamless asset transfers across blockchains. It aims to unify gaming, metaverse, and NFT ecosystems into a 'Virtual Society'. \n    Community Engagement: Initiatives like Galxe campaigns, daily check-ins, and a potential airdrop for testnet participants are part of Somnia’s strategy to attract 1 million users to stress-test the network. \n    Future Goals: Somnia aims to support real-time, data-intensive applications at scale, with a focus on gaming and social platforms. Long-term, it seeks to establish a decentralized creator economy with interoperable digital assets. \n    The roadmap emphasizes scalability, developer adoption, and ecosystem growth, but specific timelines beyond the mainnet launch are unclear.
